My experience working on Wall Street during the Financial Crisis was enough to say, \"F this\" and go my own way.\n\nMy investors are individuals looking to aggressively grow their capital as well those with an interest in adding some diversification to their portfolios.\n\nThe investment strategy my firm employs is systematic trend-following across. We look to exploit long-term trends that occur across all asset classes -- equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies and crypto.\n\nFor more information on us, please visit -- www.melissinostrading.com\n\nMy blog -- https://mikemelissinos.substack.com",

Our software platform, FM3, was built to support the range of services we offer and provides a unified front to back office platform for asset managers. Developers are embedded in our production environment and are integral to our client relationships. With our unique approach, we accept engagements with challenges that others may be unwilling or unable to undertake. You can learn more at: www.harmonicfundservices.com.\n\nOur philosophy of partnership and collaboration with our clients is embodied in our technology and tailored services: we fit the engagement to client needs, and we do not impose our operational structure on our clients.  Our business has grown primarily on personal recommendations and so our focus is always service levels, not asset accumulation. \n\nBuilding Harmonic from a small group and focused technology in one office, to a global organization with a unified software platform has been an absorbing and rewarding experience; expanding our business along with our clients, whilst learning about nearly all areas of the alternative investment industry. I particularly enjoy working with new clients, helping them make their ideas happen, tailoring our technology and client teams to facilitate their success.\n\nMy specific experience includes most alternative investment management strategies, operating structures, the major jurisdictions and their regulations – including alternative fund structures (open and close-ended), wealth management, private banks and public bank asset management.\n",

Their role goes well beyond simple financial support, helping them navigate the complex health services industry, insurance requirements and often mental health issues that accompany the diagnosis. It is awe inspiring working with people whose primary goal is simply to make a difference.\n",

I architect AI experiences that bridge human psychology with technological innovation. With a background in clinical psychology from Stanford, I've navigated diverse domains—from trailblazing health tech, to higher ed, to genAI ethics, to trust and safety, to workplace wellbeing, to clinical network leadership.\n\nWhether spearheading clinical product and content initiatives at Woebot, pioneering innovative workplace wellness programs at Google, or building the virtual Therapy function at Brightside from the ground up, my focus has always been on creating impactful, scalable, evidence-based psychological and behavioral change. Currently, as VP of Psychology at Wayhaven, I lead the development of genAI mental wellness solutions for college populations, building on my clinical experience at UC Davis and San Jose State.\n\nIn my roles at Wayhaven, Woebot, Lark, and ChatOwl, I have leveraged genAI to drive evidence-informed mental wellness interventions. My commitment to technological innovations for social good includes ensuring AI-driven mental well-being solutions are safe, effective, ethical, and inclusive. Through my professorship at Stanford, I co-created and published the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health (FAITA-Mental Health), enabling clients and clinicians to evaluate genAI technologies and advance responsible innovation in industry.\n\nCommitted to driving systemic change, I serve as a founding member of APA's Mental Health Technology Advisory Committee, Co-Chair of ABCT's AI Subcommittee, and contribute to the Society for Digital Mental Health's Industry Special Interest Group. I'm pursuing a part-time postdoctoral master's in clinical psychopharmacology while training in BC's inaugural Primary Care Psychology integrated behavioral health program—initiatives bridging traditional healthcare and digital innovation for more seamless integration into clinical workflows.\n\nAs a Forbes healthcare innovator, Digital Health Canada Emerging Health Leader, and mentor in mental wellness technology, my mission involves realizing a future where mental health is woven into all facets of life. I advise digital health and wellness startups, pharmaceutical companies, and consulting firms.\n\nLet's collaborate to push the boundaries of what's possible in mental health and well-being, together crafting a future that's as human-centered, compassionate, and ethically grounded as it is groundbreaking.",

I architect AI experiences that bridge human psychology with technological innovation. With a background in clinical psychology from Stanford, I've navigated diverse domains—from trailblazing health tech, to higher ed, to genAI ethics, to trust and safety, to workplace wellbeing, to clinical network leadership.\n\nWhether spearheading clinical product and content initiatives at Woebot, pioneering innovative workplace wellness programs at Google, or building the virtual Therapy function at Brightside from the ground up, my focus has always been on creating impactful, scalable, evidence-based psychological and behavioral change. Currently, as VP of Psychology at Wayhaven, I lead the development of genAI mental wellness solutions for college populations, building on my clinical experience at UC Davis and San Jose State.\n\nIn my roles at Wayhaven, Woebot, Lark, and ChatOwl, I have leveraged genAI to drive evidence-informed mental wellness interventions. My commitment to technological innovations for social good includes ensuring AI-driven mental well-being solutions are safe, effective, ethical, and inclusive. Through my professorship at Stanford, I co-created and published the Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health (FAITA-Mental Health), enabling clients and clinicians to evaluate genAI technologies and advance responsible innovation in industry.\n\nCommitted to driving systemic change, I serve as a founding member of APA's Mental Health Technology Advisory Committee, Co-Chair of ABCT's AI Subcommittee, and contribute to the Society for Digital Mental Health's Industry Special Interest Group. I'm pursuing a part-time postdoctoral master's in clinical psychopharmacology while training in BC's inaugural Primary Care Psychology integrated behavioral health program—initiatives bridging traditional healthcare and digital innovation for more seamless integration into clinical workflows.\n\nAs a Forbes healthcare innovator, Digital Health Canada Emerging Health Leader, and mentor in mental wellness technology, my mission involves realizing a future where mental health is woven into all facets of life. I advise digital health and wellness startups, pharmaceutical companies, and consulting firms.\n\nLet's collaborate to push the boundaries of what's possible in mental health and well-being, together crafting a future that's as human-centered, compassionate, and ethically grounded as it is groundbreaking.",

                        "description": "I have over a decade of experience researching artificial intelligence and am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) and the Department of Art and Art History. I focus on responsible AI, values alignment, and human-computer interaction in the context of computer vision applications. My peer-reviewed writing has been published by MIT Press, University of California Press, and University of Indiana Press. As a former fellow at the UC Berkeley Center for Technology, Policy, and Society, I presented to the California State Legislature in 2023 as a subject-matter expert on responsible uses of AI technology in the public sector. \n\nMy first book project, “Patterning Recognition,” contextualizes current debates about AI interpretability and the question of meaningful human control in semi-autonomous systems through an intellectual history of the interchanges between computer vision models and theories of human perception in the lead-up to contemporary deep learning and proliferating AI.\n\nMy research has been funded by competitive fellowships from the Phi Beta Kappa Alpha Chapter of California, the Stanford Mabelle McLeod Lewis Memorial Fund, the Berkeley Center for New Media, the Townsend Center for the Humanities, New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, and the Mellon Foundation, among others. \n\nI began working with AI and computer vision in 2013, as an interaction designer and creative technologist. I was fascinated by the idea of how to teach a computer to see, because the exercise forces us to think about how we see - as both biological and social beings. My art and design work has been commissioned by the LA County Museum of Art (LACMA), the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Print Screen Festival, the Magnum Foundation, The New York Times Op-Docs, and the National Film Board of Canada, among others. \n\nI believe the arts can play an important role in expanding civic engagement with the social and political issues raised by AI. In Spring 2025 I will co-teach a course at Stanford on art and generative AI. From 2020–2022 I served on the executive committee of the Berkeley Center for New Media and co-organized an ongoing arts and technology event series. I co-curated the 2022 art and technology exhibition Refamiliarization, at the Worth Rider Gallery, and the 2023 screening series The Screen and the Scroll at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA).",

To truly care about others, we must listen to their feelings about their current situations. This principle is applicable across the board, but it's particularly beneficial when interacting with our customers, as it helps us filter out a lot of unnecessary noise. The best companies are built by creating products that solve real problems that people are willing to pay for.\n\nSince starting Autharva, I've been continuously discovering just how much there is to learn and explore. I'm grateful for all the support and circumstances that have allowed me to start this company. It's been instrumental in helping me grow as a person, a professional, and a product manager.\n\nI strive to live by this principle every step of the way at Autharva. Our team is highly focused and motivates each other every day with the motto: \"The customer is always right!\"\n\nOur primary metric for prioritizing our deliverables is: \"Would our customers be excited to use this feature now?\" If the answer is yes, then it's considered a top priority (P0).\n\nAs a Product Management leader and an entrepreneur, I am committed to addressing real needs through proper prioritization, strategy, compliance, and security assurance. My previous experience in people management, customer account management, mergers and acquisitions, vendor management, and resource allocation has proven to be valuable throughout my professional journey at Autharva. \n\nI strongly believe in creating something genuinely useful and efficiently listening to stakeholders, understanding their requirements, and implementing solutions that meet their needs. I am a team player with solid experience launching enterprise security products in regulated sectors such as Fintech, Healthcare, Insurance, and Technology. \n\nAre an information security executive craving for: \n- a much better ROI on your Identity and Access Management spending? \n- a state-of-the-art customer experience with an alpha product? \n- a motivated team focused on solving your enterprise's real issues related to Identity Governance and Administration quickly? \nThen please book a call with us today!
